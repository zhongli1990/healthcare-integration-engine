## Repository Creation

1. **Created a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Navigated to [GitHub](https://github.com) and created a new repository
   - Repository name: `healthcare-integration-engine`
   - Description: "Healthcare Integration Engine - Enterprise-grade healthcare data integration platform"
   - Visibility: Private (can be changed to Public if needed)
   - No README, .gitignore, or license were added during creation

## Initial Setup

1. **Initialized local git repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/zhong/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project/.git/
   ```

2. **Added all files to staging**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Created initial commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Healthcare Integration Engine v0.1"
   ```
   Output (truncated):
   ```
   [main (root-commit) 2242a2a] Initial commit: Healthcare Integration Engine v0.1
    92 files changed, 11391 insertions(+)
    create mode 100644 Dockerfile
    create mode 100644 README.md
    ...
   ```

4. **Added remote origin**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/zhongli1990/healthcare-integration-engine.git
   ```

## Branch Management

1. **Pushed main branch to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Enumerating objects: 132, done.
   Counting objects: 100% (132/132), done.
   Delta compression using up to 8 threads
   Compressing objects: 100% (112/112), done.
   Writing objects: 100% (132/132), 136.42 KiB | 6.82 MiB/s, done.
   Total 132 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
   remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (5/5), done.
   To https://github.com/zhongli1990/healthcare-integration-engine.git
    * [new branch]      main -> main
   branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
   ```

2. **Created and switched to working branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b working
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Switched to a new branch 'working'
   ```

3. **Pushed working branch to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin working
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
   remote: 
   remote: Create a pull request for 'working' on GitHub by visiting:
   remote:      https://github.com/zhongli1990/healthcare-integration-engine/pull/new/working
   remote: 
   To https://github.com/zhongli1990/healthcare-integration-engine.git
    * [new branch]      working -> working
   branch 'working' set up to track 'origin/working'.
   ```

## Version Tags

1. **Created v0.1 tag on main branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git tag -a v0.1 -m "Initial stable release"
   ```

2. **Created v0.1.1-working tag on working branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout working
   git tag -a v0.1.1-working -m "Working version with mock authentication"
   ```

3. **Pushed all tags to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin --tags
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Enumerating objects: 2, done.
   Counting objects: 100% (2/2), done.
   Delta compression using up to 8 threads
   Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
   Writing objects: 100% (2/2), 243 bytes | 243.00 KiB/s, done.
   Total 2 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
   remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
   To https://github.com/zhongli1990/healthcare-integration-engine.git
    * [new tag]         v0.1 -> v0.1
    * [new tag]         v0.1.1-working -> v0.1.1-working
   ```

## Repository Structure

- **main**: Stable branch containing the initial release (v0.1)
  - Tag: v0.1
  - Represents the initial stable version of the application

- **working**: Development branch with the latest changes
  - Tag: v0.1.1-working
  - Contains mock authentication implementation
  - Used for active development

## Future Maintenance

### Creating a New Release
1. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to the working branch
2. Create a pull request from `working` to `main`
3. After code review, merge the pull request
4. Create a new version tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release notes here"
   git push origin --tags
   ```

### Reverting to a Previous Version
To revert to a specific version (e.g., v0.1):
```bash
git checkout v0.1
# To create a new branch from this version:
git checkout -b hotfix-branch v0.1
```

### Viewing Available Versions
```bash
git tag -l
```

## Repository URL
- GitHub: [https://github.com/zhongli1990/healthcare-integration-engine](https://github.com/zhongli1990/healthcare-integration-engine)

## Notes
- The `main` branch should always be kept stable and production-ready
- All development should happen in feature branches created from `working`
- Merge to `main` should only happen through pull requests after code review
