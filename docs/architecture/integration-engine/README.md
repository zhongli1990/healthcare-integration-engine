# Integration Engine Architecture

## Overview

The Integration Engine is a core component of the healthcare integration platform, designed to process and route healthcare messages between different systems and formats. It supports multiple protocols including HL7v2 (MLLP), FHIR (REST), and file-based inputs.

## Core Principles

1. **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous message processing
2. **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via message queues
3. **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable components
4. **Resilience**: Built-in fault tolerance and recovery
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin-based architecture for adding new protocols and processors

## Core Components

### 1. Transport Layer
Handles protocol-specific communication:
- **HL7v2 Listener**: Receives HL7v2 messages via MLLP
- **FHIR Listener**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for FHIR resources
- **File Watcher**: Monitors directories for new files to process
- Supports multiple protocols (HTTP, MLLP, SFTP, etc.)
- Validates incoming messages

### 2. Processing Pipeline
- **Validation Service**: Validates incoming messages against schemas
- **Transformation Service**: Converts between different message formats
- **Message Processing**:
  - Message parsing and validation
  - Content transformation
  - Business rule execution

### 3. Routing Layer
- **Routing Service**: Routes messages based on configurable rules
  - Content-based routing
  - Message enrichment
  - Dynamic routing rules

### 4. Connector Layer
- **HL7v2 Sender**: Sends HL7v2 messages to external systems
- **FHIR Client**: Sends FHIR resources to FHIR servers
- **File Writer**: Writes processed messages to the file system
- Connection management
- Retry and error handling

### 5. Core Services
- **Queue Manager**: Manages message queues using Redis
- **Message Model**: Defines the structure of messages in the system
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration management
